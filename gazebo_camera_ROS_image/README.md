# Gazebo_camera_ROS_image
gazebo camera ROS image (typhoon_h480 drone)


It is an algorithm developed for publishing the image taken from the cg03+ gimbal camera on the typhoon_h480 drone model in the gazebo simulation environment, via ROS.

In order to receive the image from the drone without interruption, you need to close the videoport on the QGroundStation.

or you can change udpport via .sdf in typhoon_h480 model.

If you have a problem, please don't hesitate to let me know.
